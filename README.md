# Marketing Project

The files relate to clickstream data from an e-commerce site, with the data being anonymised and consisting of the following field.
> clickstream_id | timestamp | IP address|url|is_purchased?|is_page_errored |user_session_id|city|state|country

My goal is to analyse the data to understand more about customer and purchasing behaviour. I will look into whether celebrity reviews are more influential than customer reviews, and how they both compare to video reviews. This is aimed to demonstrate Attribution analysis

In the 2nd part of the project, I will look at customer journeys and perform clickstream analysis.
